# Minesweeper
The following is my code for Minesweeper game with simple GUI. The code is from 2020.

After running the application, first ender the number of mines you would want. Note that the table is 20 x 20. Next press START button. To open a field, 
left-click with your mouse on it. To mark a field with potential mine flag, right click on it. In the counter next to the board, you will see how many mines are left
if all your potential mine guesses were correct. The interface looks like this:
